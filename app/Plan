in the workers screen, get rid of all the numbers, all i want is the name of the worker and the phone number (clickable to call).
in the control panel when looking at the payments owed, in the projects section there appears the hour of the shift which is good. but the name of the shift should appear as well.
in the event cards it's showing הכנסה get rid of this all i need is the name the date and the hours. also you make the date and hour in the same line to save space.
in the employers cards it should only show the name and the phone number (being clickable to call). all the numbers we can get rid of on the card. you can click the card to see all that info.
there should be a section for workers and employees that i can write down notes about them. this should be an option in the top left of their screens.
if the amount to be payed for a referral is 0 it should not show up in their screen.
there has to be a way to revoke payment to a worker (if the user clicks accidentally on pay, there should be a way to revoke it).
