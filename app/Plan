on the worker cards it shouldn't say יש מפנה it should say עובד של and then the name of the refernce worker. also get rid of all the numbers.all i need is the name, the phone number (clickable to call) and the reference worker name in the format of עובד של שלמה for example (שלמה is an example name)
change מזמין to מעסיק
I can't remove a worker from a shift. fix this.
the shift debt to workers is not appearing on the worker cards.
when there is a referecnce worker, the amount should that the reference gets should appear on his name in the worker info. not in the worker who was working himslef.
in the control panel when looking at the payments owed, in the projects section there appears the hour of the shift which is good. but the name of the shift should appear as well.
in the event cards it's showing הכנסה get rid of this all i need is the name the date and the hours. also you make the date and hour in the same line to save space.
in the employers cards it should only show the name and the phone number (being clickable to call). all the numbers we can get rid of on the card. you can click the card to see all that info.
there should be a section for workers and employees that i can write down notes about them. this should be an option in the top left of their screens.
