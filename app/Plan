on the worker cards it shouldn't say יש מפנה it should say עובד של and then the name of the refernce worker.
change מזמין to מעסיק
the phone problem is not fixed for the employer. meaning the first digit after the dash is moved to the back. 050-1234567 becomes 0502345671. fix this. make it the same as putting in a phone number for a worker
when entering an hour in the time field, it bounces the number put after the colon bounces to the end. so 20:40 becomes 20:04. fix this using the same logic as the phone numbers
the hour field must enforce xx:xx format. if the user tries to enter a different format it should not allow it.
in the employer card, all the logic for the numbers of how much was made how much was spent and how much profit is not working.
