1) when editing an event, it should use the current values as the default values and not have everything blank <----
2) when clicking on an even, profit is in english instead of hebrew and so is worker payment.
3) in the unpaid shifts section, there should be more details about the shift.
4) in the control panel where it shows all the financials, i hate the icons used, use better icons.
