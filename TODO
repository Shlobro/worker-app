POTENTIAL ISSUES - VERIFY
==========================

16. Date Type Conversion
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:217, 236
    Question: Is shiftDate stored as Long (millis) or Date object?
    Action: Verify data type and ensure Date(shift.shiftDate) is correct

17. Worker Deletion Cascade
    Location: Worker.kt:16
    Question: Should historical ShiftWorker/EventWorker records be preserved when worker deleted?
    Action: Verify intended behavior with product owner

18. Reference Worker Commission on Fixed Amount
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:265, EventDetailScreen.kt:299-301
    Question: Should reference workers get hourly commission when referred worker got fixed payment?
    Action: Clarify business logic with product owner


ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS
==========================

21. Split EventWorker Table
    Recommendation: Separate worker payments from reference/manager commissions
    Benefit: Clearer data model
    Tables: EventWorker (worker pay) + EventCommission (manager commission)

22. Normalize Payment Calculation Logic
    Recommendation: Create single source of truth for payment math
    Benefit: Consistent calculations across all ViewModels
    Implementation: Create PaymentCalculator class with all formulas
