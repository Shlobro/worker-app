# Screens Package Developer Guide

This package contains the Composable functions representing the full screens of the application.

## Structure

Screens are generally organized into sub-packages by feature (e.g., `employers`, `events`). Some standalone screens might reside directly in this package.

## Direct Files

- **MoneyOwedScreen.kt**: Displays the list of people who owe money or are owed money.
- **WorkerPhotoGalleryScreen.kt**: A screen for viewing worker photos.
