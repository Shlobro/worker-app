WorkerTracking App - Bug Fix TODO List
========================================

Generated: 2026-01-27
Source: Code reviews from 3 junior developers (validated)
Status: All bugs below have been validated against the codebase


CRITICAL BUGS - FIX IMMEDIATELY
================================

1. EmployerDao Join Duplication - Over-counting
   Location: EmployerDao.kt:27-66
   Problem: Complex joins between employers, projects, events, shifts, and workers create
            Cartesian products. A single worker payment gets counted multiple times when
            multiple projects/events exist.
   Example: 2 projects × 3 events × 5 workers = 30x multiplier on costs
   Impact: Employer profit/income/expense calculations are wildly incorrect
   Fix Required:
   - Rewrite getTotalProfitFromEmployer() using subqueries/CTEs
   - Rewrite getTotalIncomeFromEmployer() using subqueries
   - Rewrite getTotalExpensesFromEmployer() using subqueries
   - Aggregate sums independently before joining

2. Circular Reference Validation Missing
   Location: Worker.kt:12-17, WorkerRepository.kt:283-298
   Problem: Worker entity has self-referencing foreign key (referenceId) with no
            validation to prevent circular references (A→B→A)
   Impact: Infinite loops in payment calculations, app crashes
   Fix Required:
   - Add validation function to check reference chains before saving
   - Add database constraint or trigger to prevent cycles
   - Add cycle detection in WorkerRepository.getWorkerById() reference lookups

3. N+1 Query Problem - Severe Performance Issue
   Location: WorkersViewModel.kt:73-126, WorkerRepository.kt:283-298
   Problem: Loading worker list executes 4+ database queries per worker:
            - getUnpaidShiftWorkersForWorker(id)
            - getUnpaidEventWorkersForWorker(id)
            - getUnpaidReferenceShiftsForWorker(id) ← Also does N+1 inside with getWorkerById()
            - getUnpaidReferenceEventsForWorker(id) ← Also does N+1 inside with getWorkerById()
   Impact: 50 workers with 100 shifts = 500+ database queries, causing UI lag/ANR
   Fix Required:
   - Create WorkerWithDebtDao query that aggregates all debt in single SQL query
   - Use LEFT JOIN with SUM/GROUP BY to calculate totals
   - Return Flow<List<WorkerWithDebt>> from repository


HIGH PRIORITY BUGS
==================

4. Flow Collection Memory Leaks
   Location: EventDetailViewModel.kt:62-82, WorkerDetailViewModel.kt:109-128
   Problem: Flow collectors launched inside viewModelScope.launch create nested coroutines
            that never complete. loadAllWorkers() and loadEventWorkers() are called from
            loadEvent() which is already in viewModelScope.launch.
   Impact: Memory leaks after screen destruction, collectors run forever
   Fix Required:
   - Remove nested viewModelScope.launch from loadAllWorkers()
   - Remove nested viewModelScope.launch from loadEventWorkers()
   - Use .stateIn() or .shareIn() for hot Flows
   - OR: Launch collectors directly without nesting


MAJOR BUGS
==========

5. WorkerDao Treats Fixed Payments as Hourly (Landmine)
   Location: WorkerDao.kt:30-40
   Problem: getTotalOwedToWorker() unconditionally multiplies hours × payRate for ALL
            event_workers, ignoring isHourlyRate flag
   Code: COALESCE(SUM(ew.hours * ew.payRate), 0)  -- Wrong for fixed price
   Example: Fixed $500 × 5 hours = $2500 calculated debt instead of $500
   Impact: Dangerous landmine if method ever gets used (currently unused in UI)
   Fix Required:
   - Add CASE statement: CASE WHEN ew.isHourlyRate = 1 THEN ew.hours * ew.payRate ELSE ew.payRate END
   - Match the logic used in shift_workers part of same query

6. Worker Earnings Include Reference Payments
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:251
    Problem: Worker "earnings" calculation includes reference payments made to OTHER workers
    Impact: Worker earnings are inflated, showing more money than they actually earned
    Fix Required:
    - Remove reference payments from worker earnings calculations
    - Only include direct worker payments (payRate, amountPaid, tipAmount)

7. Project Costs Omit Reference Pay
    Location: ShiftDao.kt:28, DashboardViewModel.kt:205
    Problem: Project cost calculations don't include referencePayRate
    Impact: Project profit is under-reported whenever reference payments exist
    Fix Required:
    - Add reference payment calculations to ShiftDao cost queries
    - Update DashboardViewModel to include reference costs

8. Dashboard Date Filter Ignores Project Income
    Location: DashboardViewModel.kt:128
    Problem: Date filtering applies to shifts/events but not project_income table
    Impact: Filtered totals/profit are incorrect when date range selected
    Fix Required:
    - Apply date range filter to project_income queries
    - Ensure all income/expense calculations respect date filter



MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS
====================

9. Date Range Filter Inclusivity Issue
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:219-220
    Problem: Date filtering uses >= and <= with timestamps. If endDate is "Jan 15 00:00:00",
             shifts later that day won't be included
    Impact: Date range filtering excludes data from end date
    Fix Required:
    - Add 24 hours to endDate before comparison
    - OR: Use date-only comparison (strip time component)

10. Duplicate Worker Assignment Not Prevented
    Location: EventDetailScreen.kt:636
    Problem: UI filtering exists but no database constraint prevents duplicate worker assignments
    Impact: Same worker can be added twice if dialog opened twice before data refreshes
    Fix Required:
    - Add unique constraint: (eventId, workerId) in event_workers table
    - Add unique constraint: (shiftId, workerId) in shift_workers table
    - Handle constraint violations gracefully in UI

11. Payment Dialog Doesn't Validate Against Total
    Location: WorkerDetailScreen.kt:646-648
    Problem: Partial payment has no validation that amountPaid + currentAmountPaid <= totalDue
    Impact: Users can pay more than owed, causing negative balances
    Fix Required:
    - Add validation before saving payment
    - Show error if payment exceeds remaining balance
    - Show remaining balance in dialog

12. Missing Database Indices on Foreign Keys
    Location: All entity files
    Problem: No indices defined on foreign key columns (workerId, shiftId, eventId, etc.)
    Impact: Slow queries when joining tables, especially with large datasets
    Fix Required:
    - Add @Index annotations to all entities
    - Example: @Entity(indices = [Index("workerId"), Index("eventId")])
    - Create migration to add indices

13. Locale Hardcoded to Hebrew
    Location: Multiple files using Locale("he", "IL")
    Problem: Currency formatting hardcoded instead of using device locale
    Impact: Users in other countries see Hebrew formatting
    Fix Required:
    - Use Locale.getDefault() instead of hardcoded Locale("he", "IL")
    - OR: Add locale setting to user preferences


LOW PRIORITY / MINOR BUGS
==========================

14. Inconsistent Error Handling
    Location: All ViewModels
    Problem: Empty catch blocks silently swallow errors
    Impact: Users have no feedback when operations fail
    Fix Required:
    - Add error state to ViewModels
    - Show error messages to users

15. Worker Detail Project History Hardcoded Empty
    Location: WorkerDetailViewModel.kt:117
    Problem: Projects hardcoded to emptyList() with TODO comment
    Impact: Worker detail screen never shows project history
    Fix Required:
    - Implement actual project history query
    - Remove TODO and empty list

16. Navigation Clears Entire Backstack
    Location: MainActivity.kt:135-142
    Problem: Dashboard navigation uses popUpTo(0) { inclusive = true }
    Impact: User can't navigate back after visiting dashboard
    Note: May be intentional design, verify with product requirements

17. ShiftWorker Payment Status Not Granular
    Location: ShiftWorker entity (inferred)
    Problem: ShiftWorker only has isPaid boolean, unlike EventWorker which has amountPaid,
             tipAmount, etc.
    Impact: Shifts don't support partial payments or tips
    Fix Required:
    - Add amountPaid, tipAmount fields to ShiftWorker
    - Add referenceAmountPaid, referenceTipAmount fields
    - Update UI to support partial shift payments

18. Manual Event Bus Instead of Reactive Data
    Location: MoneyOwedViewModel.kt calling appContainer.triggerDashboardRefresh()
    Problem: ViewModels manually trigger refreshes instead of using Room Flows
    Impact: Tight coupling to DI container, unnecessary complexity
    Fix Required:
    - Use Flow<List<Data>> from Room to auto-update UI
    - Remove manual refresh triggers


POTENTIAL ISSUES - VERIFY
==========================

19. Date Type Conversion
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:217, 236
    Question: Is shiftDate stored as Long (millis) or Date object?
    Action: Verify data type and ensure Date(shift.shiftDate) is correct

20. Worker Deletion Cascade
    Location: Worker.kt:16
    Question: Should historical ShiftWorker/EventWorker records be preserved when worker deleted?
    Action: Verify intended behavior with product owner

21. Reference Worker Commission on Fixed Amount
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:265, EventDetailScreen.kt:299-301
    Question: Should reference workers get hourly commission when referred worker got fixed payment?
    Action: Clarify business logic with product owner


ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS
==========================

22. Split EventWorker Table
    Recommendation: Separate worker payments from reference/manager commissions
    Benefit: Clearer data model
    Tables: EventWorker (worker pay) + EventCommission (manager commission)

23. Normalize Payment Calculation Logic
    Recommendation: Create single source of truth for payment math
    Benefit: Consistent calculations across all ViewModels
    Implementation: Create PaymentCalculator class with all formulas
