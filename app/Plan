on the worker cards it shouldn't say יש מפנה it should say עובד של and then the name of the refernce worker.
change מזמין to מעסיק
the phone problem is not fixed for the employer. meaning the first digit after the dash is moved to the back. 050-1234567 becomes 0502345671. fix this. make it the same as putting in a phone number for a worker
when entering an hour in the time field, it bounces the number put after the colon bounces to the end. so 20:40 becomes 20:04. fix this using the same logic as the phone numbers
the hour field must enforce xx:xx format. if the user tries to enter a different format it should not allow it.
when clicking on an employer there should be an option to filter by date to see the income over a specific period.
in the worker card the amounts are correct but when i click on the worker in the screen it shows the amount as if the global payment is an hourly payment.
