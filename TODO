HIGH PRIORITY BUGS
==================


MAJOR BUGS
==========




LOW PRIORITY / MINOR BUGS
==========================

13. Inconsistent Error Handling
    Location: All ViewModels
    Problem: Empty catch blocks silently swallow errors
    Impact: Users have no feedback when operations fail
    Fix Required:
    - Add error state to ViewModels
    - Show error messages to users

14. Navigation Clears Entire Backstack
    Location: MainActivity.kt:135-142
    Problem: Dashboard navigation uses popUpTo(0) { inclusive = true }
    Impact: User can't navigate back after visiting dashboard
    Note: May be intentional design, verify with product requirements

15. ShiftWorker Payment Status Not Granular
    Location: ShiftWorker entity (inferred)
    Problem: ShiftWorker only has isPaid boolean, unlike EventWorker which has amountPaid,
             tipAmount, etc.
    Impact: Shifts don't support partial payments or tips
    Fix Required:
    - Add amountPaid, tipAmount fields to ShiftWorker
    - Add referenceAmountPaid, referenceTipAmount fields
    - Update UI to support partial shift payments

16. Manual Event Bus Instead of Reactive Data
    Location: MoneyOwedViewModel.kt calling appContainer.triggerDashboardRefresh()
    Problem: ViewModels manually trigger refreshes instead of using Room Flows
    Impact: Tight coupling to DI container, unnecessary complexity
    Fix Required:
    - Use Flow<List<Data>> from Room to auto-update UI
    - Remove manual refresh triggers


POTENTIAL ISSUES - VERIFY
==========================

17. Date Type Conversion
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:217, 236
    Question: Is shiftDate stored as Long (millis) or Date object?
    Action: Verify data type and ensure Date(shift.shiftDate) is correct

18. Worker Deletion Cascade
    Location: Worker.kt:16
    Question: Should historical ShiftWorker/EventWorker records be preserved when worker deleted?
    Action: Verify intended behavior with product owner

19. Reference Worker Commission on Fixed Amount
    Location: WorkerRepository.kt:265, EventDetailScreen.kt:299-301
    Question: Should reference workers get hourly commission when referred worker got fixed payment?
    Action: Clarify business logic with product owner


ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS
==========================

21. Split EventWorker Table
    Recommendation: Separate worker payments from reference/manager commissions
    Benefit: Clearer data model
    Tables: EventWorker (worker pay) + EventCommission (manager commission)

22. Normalize Payment Calculation Logic
    Recommendation: Create single source of truth for payment math
    Benefit: Consistent calculations across all ViewModels
    Implementation: Create PaymentCalculator class with all formulas
