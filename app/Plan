on the worker cards it shouldn't say יש מפנה it should say עובד של and then the name of the refernce worker.
change מזמין to מעסיק
I can't remove a worker from a shift. fix this.
the shift debt to workers is not appearing on the worker cards.
when there is a referecnce worker, the amount should that the reference gets should appear on his name in the worker info. not in the worker who was working himslef.
in the control panel when looking at the payments owed, in the projects section there appears the hour of the shift which is good. but the name of the shift should appear as well.
