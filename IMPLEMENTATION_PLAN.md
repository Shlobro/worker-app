# Worker Tracking App - Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

The Worker Tracking app is a comprehensive project and workforce management system built with Android Jetpack Compose. This document outlines the complete implementation including recent enhancements for multi-worker shift management, financial tracking, and enhanced user experience.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Worker Shift Management System

#### **Enhanced Shift Creation Workflow**
- **Shift-First Approach**: Create shifts without selecting workers initially
- **Time Input Enhancement**: 
  - Auto-format time input (0800 → 08:00)
  - Number keyboard for time fields
  - Automatic hours calculation from start/end times
  - Manual override with reset option
- **Post-Creation Worker Management**: Click shifts to manage workers

#### **Worker Assignment & Payment Configuration**
- **Searchable Worker Addition**: Real-time name filtering when adding workers
- **Dual Payment Types**:
  - **שכר שעתי** (Hourly Rate): `payRate × shiftHours`
  - **סכום גלובלי** (Global Amount): Fixed amount regardless of hours
- **Individual Management**: Add, edit, remove workers independently
- **Payment Editing**: Modify worker payment details after assignment

#### **Technical Implementation**
- **ShiftWorker Entity**: Many-to-many relationship between shifts and workers
- **Database Schema**: Removed direct worker-shift relationship
- **Migration Strategy**: Version 6→7 with data preservation
- **Real-time Updates**: UI refreshes automatically on changes

### 2. Complete Financial Management System

#### **Project Income Tracking**
- **ProjectIncome Entity**: Track individual income entries per project
- **Flexible Income Types**: Support for:
  - Daily work: `days × daily_rate`
  - Weekly work: `weeks × weekly_rate` 
  - Hourly work: `hours × hourly_rate`
  - Fixed projects: `amount × 1`
- **Add Income Screen**: User-friendly form with real-time calculation preview

#### **Comprehensive Financial Display**
- **Project Financial Summary Card**:
  - **Total Income**: Sum of all ProjectIncome entries
  - **Total Payments**: Sum of all worker payments across shifts
  - **Net Profit**: `Total Income - Total Worker Payments`
  - **Color Indicators**: Green for profit, red for loss

#### **Payment Calculation Engine**
- **Automatic Calculations**: 
  - Hourly workers: `hourly_rate × shift_hours`
  - Global workers: `fixed_amount`
  - Project total: Sum across all workers and shifts
- **Real-time Updates**: Financial data refreshes when:
  - Workers added/removed from shifts
  - Payment rates modified
  - New income entries added
  - Shifts created/deleted

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

#### **Intuitive Navigation**
- **Shift Detail Navigation**: Click any shift to manage workers
- **Financial Management**: "הוסף הכנסה" button for easy income entry
- **Search Integration**: Quick worker lookup with live filtering
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Logical flow from projects → shifts → workers

#### **Smart Input Handling**
- **Time Formatting**: Automatic conversion of numeric input to time format
- **Input Validation**: Prevent invalid times and amounts
- **Calculation Preview**: Show totals as users type
- **Error Prevention**: Disable actions until valid input provided

#### **Hebrew Localization**
- **Correct Terminology**: 
  - "שכר שעתי" for hourly payments
  - "סכום גלובלי" for fixed amounts (not "תשלום קבוע")
- **Consistent UI**: All interfaces in Hebrew with proper RTL support
- **Cultural Context**: Payment and time formats appropriate for Israeli market

## Database Architecture

### **Current Schema (Version 7)**

```sql
-- Core Entities
Project(id, name, location, startDate, incomeType, incomeAmount)
ProjectIncome(id, projectId, date, description, amount, units)
Worker(id, name, phoneNumber, referenceId)
Shift(id, projectId, date, startTime, endTime, hours)
ShiftWorker(id, shiftId, workerId, isHourlyRate, payRate)
Event(id, name, date, time)
EventWorker(id, eventId, workerId, hours, payRate)
Payment(id, workerId, amount, date, source)
```

### **Key Relationships**
- **Project ↔ ProjectIncome**: One-to-many (project can have multiple income entries)
- **Shift ↔ ShiftWorker ↔ Worker**: Many-to-many (shifts can have multiple workers)
- **Project ↔ Shift**: One-to-many (project has multiple shifts)
- **Worker ↔ Worker**: Self-referencing (reference relationships)

### **Migration Strategy**
- **Version 5→6**: Introduced ShiftWorker, removed direct worker-shift relationship
- **Version 6→7**: Added ProjectIncome for detailed income tracking
- **Data Preservation**: Existing shift data migrated to new structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old data remains accessible

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Repository Pattern**
- **ProjectRepository**: Enhanced with income management methods
- **ShiftRepository**: Added worker assignment and cost calculation methods
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data access layers

### **ViewModel Architecture**
- **ProjectDetailViewModel**: Manages financial data and shift information
- **ShiftDetailViewModel**: Handles worker assignment and payment configuration
- **AddIncomeViewModel**: Manages income entry workflow
- **Reactive State**: StateFlow for real-time UI updates

### **Navigation Structure**
```
Projects Screen
├── Project Detail (Financial Summary)
│   ├── Add Income Screen
│   └── Shift Detail (Worker Management)
│       └── Add Worker Dialog (Payment Configuration)
└── Add Project Screen
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **Income Entry**: User adds income → ProjectIncome record → Financial totals update
2. **Worker Assignment**: User assigns worker to shift → ShiftWorker record → Cost calculations update
3. **Financial Display**: Aggregated data from ProjectIncome + ShiftWorker → Real-time profit/loss

## User Workflows

### **Primary Workflow: Complete Project Management**

1. **Create Project**
   - Basic project information
   - Income type and base rate

2. **Add Income Entries**

   - View calculated total

3. **Create Shifts**
   - Add shift with time and duration
   - Auto-format time input (0800 → 08:00)
   - Auto-calculate hours from start/end times

4. **Manage Workers per Shift**
   - Click shift to open detail screen
   - Search and add workers
   - Configure payment type (hourly vs global)
